### Hello!
I'm Jez (he/him). 

I'm an Android developer by trade, but here I mostly have indulged in exploring games and interactive experiences beyond the Android framework, primarily with Unity.

My more recent projects have been made private so unfortunately my public profile is a little bit barren, but you can find a chronicling of the outcomes [over on my website here](https://jeremystevens.net).
